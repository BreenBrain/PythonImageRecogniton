# PythonImageRecogniton
It's a repository of an image recogntion software using open-cv.
It recognizes people from the picture as pedestrians and then spews out the number of them with the number of pictures and their ratio.I couldn't upload pictures directly to  github, so here is the link[ ] to use this unpack all of them  to separate folders with different names.
