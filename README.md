# PythonImageRecogniton
It's a repository of an image recogntion software using open-cv.
It recognizes people from the picture as pedestrians and then spews out the number of them with the number of pictures, and their ratio.


I couldn't upload pictures directly to  github, so here is the link to the google drive folder[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NfcJbOLhTaN1EcVqMWs3bUltr4BzAbz-?usp=sharing] .To use this software ,unpack all of them  so that directory looked like this : C:\MERTVV\m1  and move the code to the MERTVV folder .
