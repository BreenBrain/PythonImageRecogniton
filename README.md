# PythonImageRecogniton
It's a repository of an image recogntion software using open-cv.
It recognizes people from the picture as pedestrians and then spews out the number of them with the number of pictures, and their ratio.


I couldn't upload pictures directly to  github, so here is the link to the [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NfcJbOLhTaN1EcVqMWs3bUltr4BzAbz-?usp=sharing) .


To use this software :


1.Unpack all of them  so that directory wil  look like this : C:\MERTVV\m1 .

2.Move the code to the MERTVV folder .
